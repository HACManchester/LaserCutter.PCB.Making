  * Look into Mylar / Kapton solder paste stencils

  * Use coats of Glass paint Pebeo Vitrea for the solder mask / use the laser to remove paint on the pads before final curing
  * Add docs for Eagle gerber export
  * Consult with Ruth on the best approaches to remove the risidual left over paint via IPA
  * For the paint check what Fred Aldous has available / Halfords
