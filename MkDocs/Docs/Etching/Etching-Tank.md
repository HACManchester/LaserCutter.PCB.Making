# Etching Tank

Now we need to etch away the exposed copper

## Cutting the Board

  * Cut the board to the right size using the bandsaw, this should require less etchant afterwards

## Etching the Board
  
  * Dip the board into Ferric Chloride for 20 - 30 mins
  * use the Heater to speed up the reaction.

## Final Cleaning

  * Rinse the board with water
  * Next wash the board with Acetone (paint remover)
  * Polish to get rid of the paint
  * Try rubbing the board with a sponge
  * Rinse again with water

## Drilling the Board

Unfortunately it's not really practical to drill holes in the board with the laser

  * FR1/2 type boards have chemicals which are toxic, this likley includes the SRBP boards from maplins (which is likley to be FR2)
  * FR3 / 4 Boards use a different type of Epoxy which should be a lot safer than FR1/2
  * However FR4 boards typically use Fibre Glass, trying to cut through this will likley leave a mess and a lot of charing
  * FR3 boards may be the only option, but finding them may be difficult
