# Prepping the Copper Board

## Unwrap the Board

  * First pull off the plastic from the copper board
  * Next prep the board by roughing it up, perhaps by dipping it into etchant, or using a roughing stone
  * Next clean the board with acetone

One suggestion is to use auto primer to make the paint stick the board better

## Spray the Board

Next we need to spray the board. <br>
The general view is that the more coats of paint the better, and that there should be at least 2 coats
so that when removing the invisible layer left by the laser the smaller traces can remain on the board during cleaning

### Paint Types

There's a few different suggestions on the types of paint.
The main two mentioned in the links are

  * Black Auto primer (car paint I think)
  * Rustoleum Painters Touch 2xCoverage paint

There's also

  * Black acrylic spray paint (Krylon brand) - suggested on instructables
  * Plastifier mask (acrylic varnish / plastifiant)

I've also got some black acrylic paint from WHS Smiths to try out (Humbrol).
For black acrylic paint, the suggestion is to use 3 - 5 coats allowing time for each coat to dry.
