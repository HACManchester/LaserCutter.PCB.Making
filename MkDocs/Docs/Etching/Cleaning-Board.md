# Cleaning the board

In the areas where the paint has been burnt away there is still a residue left over that needs to be cleaned away <br>
TODO Check with Ruth on this

## Using a Q Tip

  * Soak one end of a q-tip in  rubbing alcohol (ethyl or isopropyl) and spread it on the exposed copper.
  * Try to keep it off of the black paint, because we want that to stay.
  * Use the other end of the q-tip to rub away, essentially polishing off the copper, making it shiny and ready for etching.

## Using the Dremmel

  * Use a dremmel with a soft wire brush to rub away the invisible layer left by the laser

## Other Suggestions

  * Metholated Spirits for removing the thin layer left behind by brush on paint
  * Mineral Turpentine for removing the thin layer left behind by spray on paint
  * Use a dish sponge to scrub the board
