# Making PCB's with the Laser Cutter

## Overview

This page contains a series of docs on using the Laser Cutter to make PCB's easily with different Electronic Cad Softwares.

For homebrew PCB's there are a few different approaches.
This includes the toner transfer / iron method, the toner transfer / Laminator approach (which is more accurate).

One approach is to use a laser cutter to remove paint from a Copper board, then etch the board.
This can however require a few tricks to get it right.

### Benefits

  * Accuracy
  * Repeatibility
  * Dual sided boards (with via's) / Alignment
  * Possibly Solder Masks with Glass paint, using the laser to remove paint on the exposed pads
