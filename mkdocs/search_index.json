Filter by Pin count  Filter by Library  Filter by Keywords   The  filter by pin count  does what it says on the tin, if the schematic part only has 2 pins then the pcb footprints available shown\nwill also only have 2 pins.

The  filter by keywords  is probably the closest thing to a linkage between schematic parts and pcb footprints within KiCad.\nWhen creating a schematic part it s possible to list a series of keywords, and the same can be true with PCB footprints.\nIf the selected schematic part has a keyword listed in the list of available footprints then it will show up in the result list on the right hand side.
