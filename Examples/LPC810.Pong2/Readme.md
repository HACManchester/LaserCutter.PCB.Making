Original schematic borrowed from <br>
https://github.com/Picatout/lpc810-pong/blob/master/ressource/Sch%C3%A9matique.pdf

This is just an updated schemtaic for the latest version of KiCad
It's a small circuit that allows the playing of Pong on an LPC810

This was originally licenced under the GPL 3.0, so this should be the same
