For attempt2 I'll try the following

1. use a single layer of paint on the board
2. speed 80 but with a power setting under 20

3. create a test board with varying thickness's
first for the cutline up from 0.1mm
next for the center line up from 0.1mm to at least 1mm

8mil seems to be too small for the center line / track
